# Advanced CSS Portfolio>

## Adding a Working Portfolio to GitHub

This includes; HTML, CSS, GIT, and personal uploads. This web-application's purpose is to be a working repository throughout my software development career. There are images with deployed links and sections. When a user clicks on the nav-bar links, the application jumps to a section of the page.

## Usage

The prework-study guide aims to provide the user an exemplory web application of my work. This includes a short about me section which includes a headshot photo of myself along with a quick inspirational blurb. A previous work section with deployable links. Curently other photo's used are stock photos from Unsplash, which I will link below. The contact me section contains my email, phone and GitHub account. Last but not least, my resume section deploys to a .pdf version of my resume for future employers and clients. Each section is adaptable to the user based on different screen sizes for accesibility on different devices.
